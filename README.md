## Introduction
Welcome to **Functional.DotNet**, a framework designed to enhance the functional programming experience in C#. Inspired by functional programming principles, this toolset enables developers to write more efficient, readable, and maintainable C# code.

## Why Choose Functional.DotNet?
- **Ease of Use**: Intuitive design, making functional programming in C# accessible for all levels.
- **Enhanced Code Quality**: Promotes writing predictable, less error-prone code.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates smoothly with existing C# projects.

## Documentation
For a comprehensive guide on how to integrate and utilize **Functional.DotNet** in your C# projects, please refer to our [official documentation](https://github.com/kinderbueno360/Functional.DotNet/blob/main/doc/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## What's New in Version 1.1.0
In version 1.1.0, we have introduced several new features to enhance your functional programming experience:

## OneAmong
The `OneAmong` type is a discriminated union that can hold a value of one among several possible types. It is commonly used in functional programming to represent a value that can take on different forms. Here's a sample of how to use it:

```csharp
OneAmong<int, string> value = new OneAmong<int, string>(42);
value.Match(
    Case<int>(x => Console.WriteLine($"It's an integer: {x}")),
    Case<string>(s => Console.WriteLine($"It's a string: {s}"))
);
```

## Agent
The `Agent` type provides a simple way to manage mutable state in a functional and thread-safe manner. It encapsulates state and allows you to perform operations on it safely.

## Identity
The `Identity` type is a monad that wraps a value. It's a simple container for a single value and is used to bring functional programming concepts to C#.



## Getting Started
Refer to our documentation for details on integrating and using this framework in your C# projects.

## Learning Resources
For beginners, check out my book ["Functional C#: Embracing Functional Programming in a C# World"](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Carlos-Bueno/dp/B0C2SW3FHL/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2LFDX227TD7NL&keywords=functional+c%23&qid=1704711844&sprefix=%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-3), a great resource for understanding C# functional programming.

## Features and Code Samples

### Using `Try`
```csharp
// Example of using Try for exception-safe code
Try<Uri> CreateUri(string uri) => () => new Uri(uri);
    
var uriTry = CreateUri("http://github.com");

uriTry.Run().Match(
        Success: uri => Assert.NotNull(uri),
        Exception: ex => Fail()
);
```

### Working with Option
```csharp
// Example of using Option to handle optional values
Option<User> userOption = GetUserById(userId);
userOption.Match(
    Some: user => Console.WriteLine("User found: " + user.Name),
    None: () => Console.WriteLine("User not found"));
```


## Understanding Monads
In Functional.DotNet, we delve into the concept of monads, such as Try and Option, to handle various computational contexts in a more functional way.
