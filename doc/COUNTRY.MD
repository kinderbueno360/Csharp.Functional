Utilizing ISO country codes, this record struct provides a straightforward and efficient means to handle country data within applications.

#### Key Features and Usage

##### Implicit Conversion from String

- **Purpose**: Allows for the implicit creation of a `Country` instance from a string representing the ISO country code.
- **Usage Example**:

- **Usage Example**:
```csharp
Country unitedStates = Country.United_States; // Accessing the United States instance
Country japan = Country.Japan;                // Accessing the Japan instance
```

##### Special Country Instances

- **`None`**: Represents an undefined or null country state.
- **Usage Example**:
```csharp
Country noCountry = Country.None; // Represents a lack of country specification

```
##### `GetCode` Method
