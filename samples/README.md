# Functional.DotNet Minimal API Sample

## Introduction
This project is a sample implementation of a minimal API using the `Functional.DotNet` library. It showcases a lightweight, functional approach to building APIs in .NET, emphasizing clean, maintainable, and testable code.

## What You Will See
This minimal API sample, built with `Functional.DotNet`, demonstrates:

- **Functional Programming Constructs**: Usage of functional programming paradigms in a .NET environment, making the code more concise, understandable, and less prone to errors.
- **Endpoint Definitions**: How endpoints are defined and handled in a functional style, providing clarity and separation of concerns.
- **Error Handling**: Functional ways of handling and propagating errors, leading to more robust and predictable API behavior.
- **Data Transformation**: Examples of transforming data in a functional manner, including working with collections, option types, and more.
- **Service Integration**: How external services and dependencies are integrated and managed within a functional framework.

The API includes various endpoints that demonstrate these concepts, offering a hands-on experience with functional programming in .NET.

## Minimum Requirements
- .NET 8.0 or higher
- `Functional.DotNet` library (ensure it's included in the project dependencies)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Restore Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `dotnet restore` to restore all the necessary NuGet packages, including `Functional.DotNet`.

## Running the Project
- Run `dotnet run` within the project directory to start the API.
- The API will be hosted locally, and you can interact with it using your preferred API client or browser.
